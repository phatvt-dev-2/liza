# Liza - Usage Guide

## Activation of the Contract for Pairing Agents

See [Contract Activation](../contracts/contract-activation.md).

## Liza

See [DEMO](../docs/DEMO.md) for a full example.

### Key Concepts

**Goal** — A Liza workspace (`.liza/`) is bound to a single goal. The goal is defined at `liza init` with a description and a spec reference. All tasks, sprints, and agent activity within that workspace serve this goal. To pursue a different goal, remove `.liza/` and re-initialize. One project can only have one active goal at a time.

**Checkpoints** — Execution halts at defined points (sprint completion, planning output ready) so a human can review before the system continues. This is intentional — Liza defaults to human-gated transitions between pipeline phases. If you want uninterrupted execution, enable auto-resume (`liza init --auto-resume` or press `y` in the TUI).

**Worktrees** — Agents don't work directly on your main branch. Each task gets its own [git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) (under `.worktrees/task-N/`), giving agents isolated workspaces that can't interfere with each other or with your working copy. Completed work merges into the integration branch, then into main. This means Liza requires a git repository and only one Liza context per repository.

### Project Guardrails

`GUARDRAILS.md` is an optional file at the project root that defines project-specific constraints for Liza agents. It uses the same tier system (Tier 0-3) from the core contract:

- **Tier 0 (Inviolable)** — Triggers mandatory halt (RESET) if violated
- **Tier 1 (Hard Constraints)** — Suspended only with explicit waiver
- **Tier 2 (Strong Defaults)** — Best-effort under pressure
- **Tier 3 (Preferences)** — Degraded gracefully

**How it's created:** `liza init` writes a template with empty tier sections. You can also create it manually.

**How to use it:** Fill in the tier sections with project-specific rules. Agents read and enforce `GUARDRAILS.md` automatically during their initialization sequence. If the file doesn't exist, agents are governed by the core contract only.

### Quick Start (Target Usage)

**Prerequisites:**
- Claude Code CLI and git installed
- Go >= 1.25.5 installed
- `liza` Go binary in PATH (see `make install`)

**Installing the Liza CLI:**

```bash
# Latest release (macOS/Linux)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liza-mas/liza/main/install.sh | bash

# Build from main branch (requires Go and make)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liza-mas/liza/main/install.sh | BRANCH=main bash

# Or from a local clone
make install

# Verify
liza version
```

**1. Global Setup (one-time)**
```bash
liza setup          # installs contracts, skills, and support docs to ~/.liza/
liza setup --force  # overwrite existing (e.g., after liza upgrade)
liza setup --agent-tools ~/my-agent-tools.md  # use custom AGENT_TOOLS.md
```

> **⚠️ `AGENT_TOOLS.md` must be customized before serious multi-agent use.**
> Agents treat it as an operational contract. If it names tools you do not
> actually have, or tools that are incompatible with worktree-heavy execution,
> they will burn context, make worse tool choices, and may reason over stale
> indexes. IDE-specific MCP tools on worktrees should be used with care:
> keep only the ones that do not rely on a centralized index tied to one
> project state.
>
> Read and apply [Customizing AGENT_TOOLS.md](CUSTOMIZING_AGENT_TOOLS.md)
> before your first run. If needed, install your own version directly with
> `liza setup --agent-tools ~/my-agent-tools.md`.

**2. Initialize Project**

> **Commit your spec file before running `liza init`.** Worktrees are created from the current branch — uncommitted files won't be visible to agents.

```bash
# Interactive wizard (recommended for first use):
liza init
# Walks through: mode selection → agent selection → project details → conflict resolution

# Or with explicit flags:
liza init "[Goal description]" --spec [spec_ref]

# spec_ref: Path to goal specification (default: specs/vision.md)
# Examples:
#   liza init "Implement retry logic"                        # uses specs/vision.md
#   liza init "Add auth" --spec specs/auth-feature.md        # uses custom spec
#
# Pipeline config (--config defaults to ~/.liza/pipeline.yaml, installed by liza setup):
#   liza init "Sub-pipelines phase 2" \
#     --post-worktree-cmd "make sync-embedded" \
#     --spec specs/build/2\ -\ Sub-pipelines\ and\ spec\ writing.md
#
# Worktree setup: If package.json is detected and --post-worktree-cmd is not set,
# liza init auto-suggests the right install command (npm/yarn/pnpm/bun).
# See CONFIGURATION.md § "Worktree Setup" for details.
#
# Integration branch (--branch sets the branch name, default: "integration"):
#   liza init "Build auth system" --branch develop
#
# Entry points (--entry-point selects which sub-pipeline to start from):
#   liza init "Build auth system" --entry-point general-objective   # full pipeline: epic → US → code-plan → code
#   liza init "Implement from spec" --entry-point detailed-spec     # coding pipeline: architecture → code-plan → code
#   # If omitted, the orchestrator auto-classifies from the spec content.

# Verify
cat .liza/state.yaml
```

`liza init` creates:
- `.liza/state.yaml` — Blackboard state
- `.liza/pipeline.yaml` — Frozen pipeline config (validated copy of the selected `--config`, default: `~/.liza/pipeline.yaml`)
- `.liza/log.yaml` — Activity log
- `.claude/settings.json` — Claude Code project permissions (Liza CLI, skills, git/build commands)
- `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md` — Symlinks to `~/.liza/CORE.md`
- `GUARDRAILS.md` — Project-specific constraints template (if not already present)
- Integration branch (default `integration`, configurable via `--branch`) — For merging completed work

Contracts and skills live in `~/.liza/` (global, from `liza setup`), not in the project.
Operational reference content (blackboard fields, anomaly types, etc.) is inlined directly into agent prompts.

**3. Start Agents**

The TUI (`liza tui`) is the primary way to spawn and monitor agents. Press `s` to spawn with the configured default CLI (role names autocomplete from the pipeline config), or `S` to pick a specific CLI.

Alternatively, spawn agents from the CLI: `liza agent <role>`. Agent identity defaults to the first `{role}-N` not already registered with a valid lease (e.g., `coder-1`, or `coder-2` if `coder-1` is active). Override with `--agent-id` or the `LIZA_AGENT_ID` environment variable.

Roles are organized into three sub-pipelines (specification, coding, integration). Which agents you need depends on your entry point:

```
Roles:
  orchestrator            - Creates and manages task breakdown

  Specification phase (general-objective entry point):
  epic-planner            - Decomposes vision into epics
  epic-plan-reviewer      - Reviews epic decomposition
  us-writer               - Writes user stories from epics
  us-reviewer             - Reviews user stories

  Architecture phase (both entry points):
  architect               - Defines component boundaries, interfaces, and structural decisions
                            (receives parent task context from upstream US tasks or goal spec)
  architecture-reviewer   - Reviews architectural coherence and structural soundness

  Coding phase (both entry points):
  code-planner            - Claims and produces coding plans
  code-plan-reviewer      - Reviews coding plans and submits verdicts
  coder                   - Claims and implements coding tasks
  code-reviewer           - Reviews coding tasks and submits verdicts

  Integration phase (post-coding, orchestrator-triggered):
  integration-analyst     - Scans full branch diff for cross-task integration issues
  integration-reviewer    - Validates and enriches integration findings
```

**Minimal setup (detailed-spec entry point) — 7 agents:**
Spawn from the TUI (`s`): orchestrator, architect, architecture-reviewer, code-planner, code-plan-reviewer, coder, code-reviewer.

**Full pipeline (general-objective entry point) — 11 agents:**
All of the above plus: epic-planner, epic-plan-reviewer, us-writer, us-reviewer.

**Integration phase** agents (integration-analyst, integration-reviewer) are spawned by the orchestrator after all coding tasks for a goal complete. They are not needed at startup — spawn them when the orchestrator triggers the integration sub-pipeline.

Each agent command accepts a `--cli` flag to select the coding agent CLI: `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `mistral`, or `kimi`. When `--cli` is omitted, the default is resolved from `config.default_cli` in `state.yaml`, then `LIZA_DEFAULT_CLI` env var, then `claude`. Set the default at init time with `liza init --default-cli codex "..."`, or edit `state.yaml` directly.
In the TUI, `s` spawns with the configured default CLI; `S` prompts for CLI selection.

Agent output is automatically persisted to `.liza/agent-outputs/` (stdout as `.txt`, stderr as `.err`). Pass `--no-log` to disable. Persisted files are automatically masked — secret values from environment variables (API keys, tokens, passwords) are replaced with `***`. Live terminal output remains unmasked. Logging is automatically disabled in `-i` (interactive) mode.
See [Analyzing Agent Logs](#analyzing-agent-logs) for analysis tools.

Multiple agents of the same role can run in parallel (IDs auto-increment):
```bash
liza agent coder              # auto-assigns coder-1
liza agent coder              # auto-assigns coder-2
liza agent coder --agent-id coder-5   # explicit ID
```

**3. Observe and control**

`liza tui` shows live system state — agents, tasks, alerts, sprint metrics. Keyboard shortcuts: `s` spawn (default cli), `S` spawn (pick cli), `p` pause, `r` resume, `a` add task, `c` checkpoint, `y` yolo (toggle auto-resume), `Q` stop.

From the CLI:
```bash
# Pause all agents
liza pause

# Resume
liza resume

# Abort
liza stop

# Checkpoint (halt + generate summary)
liza sprint-checkpoint

# Activity log
cat .liza/log.yaml
```

**Signal handling:** Agents cleanly exit on `Ctrl+C` (SIGINT) or `kill` (SIGTERM). On exit, the agent unregisters and atomically releases any active task claim — the task returns to its initial state (doer, e.g. DRAFT_CODE) or submitted state (reviewer, e.g. CODE_READY_FOR_REVIEW) — so no orphaned claims are left behind.

**4. Review Results**
```bash
# Integration branch
git log integration --oneline
```

### Running Multiple Sprints

When all tasks in a sprint reach terminal state (MERGED/ABANDONED), `liza resume` marks the sprint COMPLETED. Running `liza resume` a second time archives the completed sprint, creates a new IN_PROGRESS sprint, and executes available pipeline transitions — creating child tasks for the next role-pair.

#### Auto-Resume (Yolo Mode)

By default, checkpoints and sprint completions require manual `liza resume`. Enable auto-resume to skip these gates and keep the system rolling:

- **At init time:** `liza init --auto-resume "Goal"`
- **At runtime:** Press `y` in the TUI to toggle (shows "Auto-resume: ON/OFF" on the status line)

When auto-resume is enabled, agents automatically call `liza resume` when they detect CHECKPOINT or COMPLETED sprint status. Use `p` (pause) for a hard stop — pause is never auto-resumed.

To start a completely fresh goal, remove the blackboard and re-initialize:

```bash
rm -rf .liza
liza init "<new goal>" --spec <spec_ref>
```

### Sprint Lifecycle & Human Gates

Liza runs in sprints. Each sprint executes one role-pair (doer + reviewer) from the pipeline.
Human checkpoints gate transitions between pairs (unless auto-resume is enabled).

#### Pipeline & Entry Points

The pipeline defines which role-pairs execute and how tasks flow between them:

```
general-objective entry point (full pipeline):
  epic-planning-pair → us-writing-pair → architecture-pair → code-planning-pair → coding-pair

detailed-spec entry point (coding pipeline):
  architecture-pair → code-planning-pair → coding-pair

integration sub-pipeline (post-coding, orchestrator-triggered):
  integration-pair → coding-pair (fix tasks)
```

Each transition between pairs is a **human gate** (unless auto-resume is enabled): the sprint completes, the human reviews, then runs `liza proceed <task-id> <transition>` followed by `liza resume`. With auto-resume, these transitions happen automatically.

The `integration-to-fix` transition is an exception — it uses `trigger: auto`, meaning fix tasks are created automatically when the integration reviewer approves findings, without a human gate.

#### Sprint Phases

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                         │
│  1. Orchestrator creates task for current pair          │
│  2. Doer claims task, does work, populates output[]     │
│  3. Reviewer approves → task merges                     │
│  4. All tasks done → SPRINT_COMPLETE                    │
│  5. Sprint checkpoints → HUMAN GATE (or auto-resumed)   │
│                                                         │
│  Human reviews results, then (manual mode):             │
│    liza resume                       (complete sprint)  │
│    liza resume                     (start next sprint)  │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Transitions create child tasks from the parent's `output[]` entries (per-subtask cardinality), from the parent task itself (one-to-one cardinality), or from multiple parent tasks in a cohort (many-to-one cardinality). Available transitions are defined in `.liza/pipeline.yaml`.

#### What Humans Do at Checkpoints

When a sprint checkpoints (status: CHECKPOINT), all agents pause.
The human reviews what agents produced and decides what to do next.

**Start with a summary.** Run `/checkpoint-summary` in any pairing agent session to get
a prioritized digest of agent decisions, open points, and risks — what needs your input,
what needs confirmation, and what's just informational. This is faster than reading every
artifact yourself and surfaces unflagged decisions agents baked in without marking.

| Action | Command | When                                                                                                 |
|--------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Accept & resume | `liza resume` | Satisfied with planner output, continue the sprint, start next sprint                                |
| Amend & replan | Edit plan file, commit, then `liza replan` | Want to change a planner's output before proceeding                                                  |
| Pipeline transition | `liza proceed <task-id> <transition>` | Create child tasks for the next role-pair from output[]. Automatically done in batch by `liza resume` |
| Pause for manual work | (no command) | Want to make manual changes before continuing                                                        |
| Abort | `liza stop` | Want to stop entirely                                                                                |

**`liza proceed`** creates child tasks from a completed task's `output[]` entries based on the pipeline transition's cardinality (`per-subtask`: one child per output entry, `one-to-one`: single child from parent, `many-to-one`: all sibling tasks in a cohort must reach approved status, then one child is created linked to all parents — used by the `us-to-coding` transition to fan N approved user stories into one architecture task). Use `liza status` to see available transitions for tasks at terminal states. After `proceed`, run `liza resume` to start the next sprint.

#### Replanning at Checkpoint

When a planning sprint checkpoints (trigger: `PLANNING_COMPLETE`), the planner's `output[]` entries represent the proposed task breakdown. The human may:

1. **Accept the plan** — run `liza resume` to continue
2. **Amend the plan** — edit the plan markdown file, commit, then run `liza replan`

`liza replan` invalidates the old planning task's output and creates a new planning task with the same role-pair and spec. The sprint returns to IN_PROGRESS and the planner agent picks up the new task, re-reads the amended plan, and regenerates `output[]`.

```bash
# Typical replan workflow
vim specs/plan.md                      # edit the plan
git add specs/plan.md && git commit -m "amend plan"
liza replan                            # auto-detects the planning task
# or, if multiple planning tasks exist:
liza replan code-planning-1            # specify task ID explicitly
```

The old task's output is preserved for audit (not cleared), just marked as superseded. Multiple replans increment the counter: `code-planning-1-replan-1`, `code-planning-1-replan-2`, etc.

#### Sprint Status Flow

```
IN_PROGRESS → CHECKPOINT ──→ COMPLETED ──→ (new sprint) IN_PROGRESS
                  │  ↑            ↑              ↑
                  │  │            │              └── liza resume (2nd: archive & advance)
                  │  │            └── liza resume (1st: all tasks terminal → mark COMPLETED)
                  │  └── orchestrator calls liza_sprint_checkpoint
                  │
                  ├── liza resume  (mid-sprint: not all terminal → back to IN_PROGRESS)
                  └── liza replan  (amend plan → new planning task → back to IN_PROGRESS)
```

**`liza resume` has two behaviors depending on sprint state:**
- **At CHECKPOINT** (not all tasks terminal): resumes the current sprint as IN_PROGRESS
- **At CHECKPOINT** (all tasks terminal): marks sprint COMPLETED. Run `liza resume` a second time to archive the sprint, create a new one, and execute available pipeline transitions

### CLI Commands

The `liza` binary provides all system operations. Key commands:

| `liza claim-task <task-id> <agent-id>` | Atomically claim a task for a doer agent (creates worktree, updates state) |
| `liza submit-for-review <task-id> [commit-ref]` | Submit a task for review (doer agents; defaults to worktree `HEAD`) |
| `liza submit-verdict <task-id> <APPROVED\|REJECTED> [--reason "<reason>"]` | Submit a review verdict (reviewer agents; `--reason` required for REJECTED) |
| `liza mark-blocked <task-id>` | Mark a task as BLOCKED with reason and questions |
| `liza assess-blocked <task-id>` | Record orchestrator assessment of a BLOCKED task (prevents re-wake loops) |
| `liza assess-hypothesis-exhausted <task-id>` | Record orchestrator assessment of a hypothesis-exhausted task (2+ coders failed) |
| `liza cancel-task <task-id> --reason "..."` | Cancel a task (transition to ABANDONED with audit trail) |

| `liza supersede-task <task-id> [replacements] --reason "..."` | Mark a task as SUPERSEDED (with or without replacements) |
| `liza proceed <task-id> <transition>` | Execute inter-pair pipeline transition (e.g., code-plan-to-coding) |
| **Worktree Management** | |
| `liza wt-create <task-id>` | Create a worktree for an executing task |
| `liza wt-merge <task-id>` | Merge an approved task into the integration branch (reviewer agents) |
| `liza wt-delete <task-id>` | Delete a worktree for a completed/abandoned task |
| **Recovery** | |
| `liza recover-task <task-id>` | Recover by task ID (release claims + remove worktree/branch) |
| `liza recover-agent <agent-id>` | Recover by agent ID (release claim + remove worktree + delete agent) |
| `liza release-claim <task-id> [--role R]` | Release claim on a task (manual, granular recovery) |
| `liza delete agent <id>` / `liza delete task <id>` | Delete an agent or task from state |
| **Analysis** | |
| `liza validate` | Validate blackboard state against schema invariants |
| `liza analyze` | Run circuit breaker pattern detection |
| `liza update-sprint-metrics` | Recompute sprint metrics from current state |
| `liza clear-stale-review-claims` | Clear expired review leases |
| `liza get <query>` | Query state data (tasks, agents, etc.) |

**Important:** The supervisor claims tasks *before* starting the agent CLI. This avoids interactive permission prompts in non-interactive mode. Agents receive their assigned task in the bootstrap prompt and should NOT call claim commands directly.

See [Architecture Overview](../specs/architecture/overview.md) for detailed component descriptions.

### Configuring Claude Code

`liza init` creates the Claude Code configuration automatically:

**`.claude/settings.json`** — Permissions for Claude Code agents (Liza CLI permissions shown, hooks, MCP servers).

The full template also pre-approves skills (code-review, testing, debugging, etc.), git read/write commands, build tools, shell utilities, and web access (WebFetch, WebSearch, LSP). See `internal/embedded/claude-settings.json` for the complete list.

> **⚠️ Dev ecosystem tools must be allowed.** Agents run non-interactively — they cannot
> answer permission prompts. Any tool not listed in `permissions.allow` will silently fail
> or stall the agent. The default template pre-configures common ecosystems:
>
> | Ecosystem | Pre-configured tools |
> |-----------|---------------------|
> | Python | `uv`, `ruff`, `pytest`, `mypy`, `pip`, `pre-commit` |
> | Go | `go`, `make` |
> | Rust | `cargo`, `rustfmt`, `clippy-driver` |
> | Node.js | `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `bun`, `eslint`, `prettier`, `tsc` |
>
> If your project uses tools not in this list, add them to `.claude/settings.json` before
> spawning agents. Run `/liza-logs` after your first sprint to catch any remaining
> permission denials. Run `/context-engineering` when logs point to prompt bloat,
> missing context, or poor handoffs.

CLI commands (e.g., `liza add-task`) operate on `.liza/state.yaml` with proper locking. Agents use CLI commands via Bash with `--json` for structured output.

The settings template is embedded into the binary. `liza init` writes the active copy to `.claude/settings.json` in the project directory.

### Analyzing Agent Logs

Agent logs are your primary diagnostic tool for understanding what agents actually did and where they got stuck. **Use `/liza-logs` early and often** — it cross-correlates logs across agents, surfaces patterns that slow down the execution and increase token usage, and proposes actionable fixes. Use `/context-engineering` when the likely cause is prompt payload shape, context bloat, missing or duplicated context, cacheability, or weak handoff fit.

#### Identifying Frictions

Log analysis serves different purposes depending on where you are in your Liza journey:

**New users — misconfiguration detection.** Most early failures come from setup issues, not agent logic. Common culprits: incomplete `AGENT_TOOLS.md` (missing tool permissions, wrong MCP server names), missing `GUARDRAILS.md` constraints, incorrect `--post-worktree-cmd`, or stale `~/.liza/` files after an upgrade. Run `/liza-logs` after your first sprint — it will flag permission denials, tool failures, and initialization errors that point straight to the misconfiguration.

**Seasoned users — regression and drift detection.** Once your setup is stable, log analysis shifts to catching new frictions: provider CLI updates that change output formats or break flags, context budget regressions from prompt growth, new tool failure patterns, or behavioral drift after contract changes. Run `/liza-logs` when a previously-smooth pipeline starts producing unexpected checkpoints, rejections, or BLOCKED tasks.

In both cases, the pattern is the same: run the analysis, read the friction report, fix the root cause, re-run. Logs are cheap; debugging blind is expensive. When `/liza-logs` shows token pressure, repeated broad searches, or handoff/rejection patterns, follow with `/context-engineering` to inspect the paired `.liza/agent-prompts/` and `.liza/agent-outputs/` evidence.

#### Log Format

Logs are captured by default (disable with `--no-log`) as NDJSON files (one JSON object per line) from `claude --verbose --output-format stream-json`. Two formats exist depending on the agent role:

| Format | First event | Seen in | Token detail |
|--------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| **Rich** | `type: system` | Orchestrator | Per-API-call breakdown (input, cache, output) |
| **Sparse** | `type: thread.started` | All doer and reviewer roles | Aggregate only (`turn.completed`) |

Both analysis tools auto-detect the format.

**LLM-assisted analysis** — use a coding agent to cross-correlate logs, diagnose patterns and propose fixes:

```
/liza-logs
```

This works with any coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) in pairing mode. The agent runs the analyzer, reads the reports, correlates errors across agents, and suggests actionable fixes.

For prompt/context-specific diagnosis, run:

```
/context-engineering
```

That skill pairs prompts and outputs by role and timestamp, then audits context quality, cacheability, load-on-demand opportunities, tool-output pressure, and cross-agent handoff fit. Its corpus indexer supports both Claude rich stream-json logs and Codex sparse `item.completed` logs.

**CLI analyzer** (`~/.liza/skills/liza-logs/scripts/analyze-log.py`) — stdlib-only Python 3.12+, for batch/CI use:

```bash
# Single file
python3 ~/.liza/skills/liza-logs/scripts/analyze-log.py .liza/agent-outputs/orchestrator-1-*.txt

# Multiple files
python3 ~/.liza/skills/liza-logs/scripts/analyze-log.py .liza/agent-outputs/*.txt
```

Report sections: session header, token summary (fresh/cached/output, cache hit rate), content breakdown by type (chars, estimated tokens, share %), top 10 items by size, tool call frequency. Rich format adds per-turn context growth and cost breakdown.

**Browser analyzer** (`liza-session-analyzer.html`) — drag-and-drop, visual charts:

```bash
open ~/.liza/skills/liza-logs/tools/liza-session-analyzer.html   # or xdg-open on Linux
```

Drop one or more log files. Produces the same analysis with bar charts for content breakdown and context growth.

**Raw inspection** with `jq` (no dependencies):

```bash
# Sparse format: extract items
jq -c 'select(.item) | .item | {type, text, command, tool, usage}
  | with_entries(select(.value != null))' .liza/agent-outputs/coder-1-*.txt

# Rich format: extract token usage per API call
jq -c 'select(.type == "assistant") | {id: .message.id, usage: .message.usage}' \
  .liza/agent-outputs/orchestrator-1-*.txt
```

**Interactive diagnosis** — open a regular coding agent session (`claude`, `codex`, etc.) in the project directory. It can read `.liza/state.yaml`, agent logs, and prompts — everything needed to diagnose issues interactively. The `/liza-logs` and `/context-engineering` skills work this way.

### Submit, Await Verdict, Handle Result

Doer agents (coders, planners, writers) use a blocking workflow for review cycles:

1. `liza_submit_for_review` — submit completed work
2. `liza_await_verdict` — block until reviewer issues verdict
3. Handle verdict:
  - **REJECTED**: Fix issues, resubmit (session stays alive — no cold restart)
  - **APPROVED** / **NEW_ATTEMPT** / **TIMEOUT** / **ABORTED**: Exit normally

This reduces per-rejection overhead from ~47s (cold restart) to near-zero. The call is budget-aware — it refuses if the iteration limit would be exceeded on rejection.

### Review, Reject, Await Resubmission

Reviewer agents use a blocking workflow after non-terminal rejections:

1. `liza_submit_verdict` — issue REJECTED verdict with feedback
2. `liza_await_resubmission` — block until doer resubmits
3. Handle result:
  - **RESUBMITTED**: Review the new changes (session stays alive — no cold restart)
  - **TERMINAL** / **TIMEOUT** / **ABORTED**: Exit normally

This mirrors the doer-side `liza_await_verdict` flow, reducing per-rejection overhead from ~47s (cold restart) to near-zero for reviewers. Do not call after terminal rejections (`EscalatedToBlocked` or `NewAttemptTriggered`).

### Differences from Pairing Mode

| Aspect | Pairing Mode | Multi-Agent Mode |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| Approval | Human approves | Peer agent approves |
| Gates | Approval request → wait | Pre-execution checkpoint → proceed |
| Communication | Conversation | Blackboard |
| Iteration | Human feedback | Reviewer agent feedback |
| Debugging | Debugging skill | Log anomaly, BLOCKED |
| Magic Phrases | Active | Not applicable |
| Session Init | Greet user | Silent execution |

### Supervisor Circuit Breaker

The supervisor automatically handles these conditions (transparent to agents):

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Agent crash loop (3× in 5min) | Supervisor stops the agent |
| Blackboard validation fails | All agents pause |
| Integration branch conflict | Task set to INTEGRATION_FAILED |
| Circuit-breaker pattern detected in anomalies | Set mode to `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TRIPPED`, create sprint `CHECKPOINT`, write reports |
