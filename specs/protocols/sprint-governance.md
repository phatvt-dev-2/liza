# Sprint Governance

## Rationale

Sprints in Liza serve a different purpose than in Scrum. Agents don't need sustainable pace or team commitment rituals. Sprints exist for:

1. **Budget gates** — bound calendar time and compute cost
2. **Human checkpoints** — forced review points before drift compounds
3. **Spec evolution windows** — structured opportunities to update requirements
4. **Metrics collection** — data for calibrating future sprints

---

## Sprint Definition

```yaml
sprint:
  id: sprint-1
  goal_ref: goal-1
  scope:  # Note: 'scope' not 'tasks' — see blackboard-schema.md for canonical field names
    planned: [task-1, task-2, task-3, task-4, task-5]
    stretch: [task-6]
  timeline:
    started: 2025-01-17T09:00:00Z
    deadline: 2025-01-19T18:00:00Z
  status: IN_PROGRESS  # IN_PROGRESS, CHECKPOINT, COMPLETED, ABORTED
```

**Sprint ends when ANY of:**
- All planned tasks reach terminal state (MERGED, ABANDONED, SUPERSEDED)
- All non-terminal planned tasks BLOCKED (sprint stalled)
- Calendar deadline reached
- Circuit breaker triggered
- Human requests checkpoint

**Sprint Completion Semantic:**

"Planned tasks" = tasks listed in `sprint.scope.planned[]`. The planned list is updated in two ways:
- **At sprint creation:** initial task list is set
- **By pipeline transitions:** when `ExecuteAvailableTransitions` creates child tasks from a merged planning task, children are automatically added to `sprint.scope.planned[]`

Tasks created mid-sprint via orchestrator rescoping (e.g., task-3a and task-3b replacing SUPERSEDED task-3) are **not** automatically added to the planned list.

This means:
- Pipeline-created children (from planning → coding transitions) are tracked in sprint scope and prevent premature sprint completion
- Orchestrator-created replacement tasks are NOT in scope — a sprint can complete while they are still in progress
- Sprint metrics may show more `tasks_done` than originally planned (includes replacements)
- Sprint boundaries are for human planning cadence, not work completion guarantees

If precise work-completion tracking is needed, human should update `sprint.scope.planned[]` when rescoping, or wait for all active tasks (planned + unplanned) to finish before considering sprint complete.

## Sprint Scope Sizing

Sprint size is measured in **tasks, not tokens**. Token cost is observed post-hoc for future calibration.

| Project Phase | Recommended Sprint Size |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Bootstrap (first sprint) | 3-5 tasks |
| Steady state | 5-8 tasks |
| Complex/risky work | 3-5 tasks |

**Rationale:** Smaller sprints = more frequent checkpoints = faster course correction.

---

## Checkpoint Protocol

Checkpoints are **mandatory human review points**. No work proceeds until human releases.

### Checkpoint Triggers

| Trigger | Automatic? | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Sprint tasks complete | Yes | Normal completion |
| Sprint deadline reached | Yes | Time box enforced |
| Circuit breaker fired | Yes | Systemic issue detected |
| Sprint stalled | Yes | All non-terminal planned tasks BLOCKED |
| `liza sprint-checkpoint` | Manual | Human-initiated review |

### Checkpoint Timeout Behavior

Checkpoints are not auto-cleared. If human does not respond:

| Duration | Watcher Action | Escalation |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| 30 min | `⚠️ CHECKPOINT STALE` | Log only |
| 2 hours | `🚨 CHECKPOINT STUCK` | Log anomaly |
| 8 hours | `🚨 CHECKPOINT ABANDONED?` | Log anomaly, suggest abort |

**External Notification (v1.1 — not implemented in v1):**

Webhook escalation is planned for v1.1. The `config.escalation_webhook` field in state.yaml is reserved but not yet functional.

When implemented, watcher will post to webhook at 2h and 8h thresholds:
```json
// Webhook Payload (POST, Content-Type: application/json)
{
  "event": "checkpoint_stuck",
  "duration_hours": 2,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-17T16:00:00Z",
  "sprint": "sprint-1",
  "checkpoint_since": "2025-01-17T14:00:00Z",
  "tasks_waiting": 3,
  "escalation_file": "CHECKPOINT_STUCK since 2025-01-17T14:00:00Z..."
}
```

**Design Principle:**
- Agents remain paused indefinitely — no automatic resume or abort
- Escalation is notification only, not action
- Human must explicitly act (`liza resume` or `liza stop`)
- Unattended checkpoints are not errors; they're paused work awaiting decision

**v1 Assumption: Human Availability**

Liza assumes human will respond to escalations within a reasonable timeframe. If human is unavailable:
- Work pauses indefinitely (safe default)
- No data loss or corruption risk
- Sprint can resume when human returns (state persists in `.liza/`)

This is acceptable for v1 because:
1. Target users are solo/small teams who control their own schedules
2. "Safe pause" is preferable to autonomous decisions requiring human judgment
3. Webhook notifications reduce risk of forgotten checkpoints

**Not Supported (v1):** Automatic timeout-based abort, delegation to backup human, or SLA-based escalation paths. These require organizational context Liza doesn't have.

**Manual Override Path:**
- To resume: `liza resume`
- To abort: `liza stop`

**CHECKPOINT File Format:**
```
2025-01-17T14:00:00Z
```
- **Only the timestamp is required** (ISO 8601 format)
- Watcher uses this for stale detection
- If human creates manually via `touch`, timestamp may be missing — watcher handles this gracefully by using file mtime
- Optional: add human-readable notes after the timestamp line (ignored by tooling)

### Checkpoint Sequence

```
1. HALT
   ├── All agents complete current atomic operation
   ├── Commit any pending changes
   ├── Write state to blackboard
   └── Exit gracefully (code 42)

2. CHECKPOINT file created (automatic or manual)
   └── Supervisors wait (same as PAUSE behavior)

3. HUMAN REVIEW
   ├── Read sprint-summary in blackboard
   ├── Review anomalies section
   ├── Review metrics
   ├── Assess goal alignment
   └── Decide next action

4. HUMAN DECISION
   ├── CONTINUE → Remove CHECKPOINT, agents resume
   ├── ADJUST_SPECS → Update specs/, then CONTINUE
   ├── ADJUST_CONTRACTS → Update contracts/, then CONTINUE
   ├── REPLAN → Set tasks to BLOCKED, planner rescopes
   ├── PIVOT → Major scope change, new sprint
   └── STOP → Create ABORT file

5. DOCUMENT DECISION
   └── Add entry to sprint.retrospective with rationale
```

## Retrospective Protocol

Retrospectives are **data-driven**, not feeling-based. The blackboard provides the data.

**Owner:** Human produces the retrospective, using data from blackboard (log.yaml, anomalies, metrics). Agents provide raw data; human synthesizes patterns and actions.

**Write Mechanism:** Human edits `.liza/state.yaml` directly to populate the `sprint.retrospective` field. Use any text editor to paste the retrospective YAML structure into the sprint section.

### Retrospective Timing

| Event | Retrospective? |
|-------|---------------|
| Sprint checkpoint | Mini-retro (metrics + patterns) |
| Goal completion | Full retro |
| Circuit breaker | Incident retro |
| Human request | Ad-hoc retro |

### Retrospective Inputs

| Source | Data |
|--------|------|
| `log.yaml` | State transitions, timing |
| `anomalies` section | Retries, trade-offs, blocked reasons |
| `sprint.metrics` | Counts, durations |
| `discovered` section | Adjacent problems found |

### Retrospective Output

```yaml
retrospective:
  timestamp: 2025-01-19T18:30:00Z

    tasks_planned: 5
    tasks_completed: 4

```

## Spec Evolution Protocol

Specs are **living documents** but changes must be controlled and audited.

### When Specs Change

| Trigger | Process |
|---------|---------|
| Checkpoint reveals gap | Human updates during checkpoint |
| Circuit breaker (spec-level) | Mandatory update before resume |
| Discovered item escalated | Planner flags, human decides |
| Assumption invalidated | Block task, update spec, then resume |

### Spec Change Process

```
1. IDENTIFY gap or error in spec
2. PAUSE affected work (tasks → BLOCKED with "spec update pending")
3. UPDATE spec (human edits, add changelog, commit)
4. LOG change in activity log (log.yaml: action=spec_updated)
5. ASSESS impact (which tasks affected? rescope needed?)
6. RESUME (unblock tasks, agents re-read specs on restart)
```

### Spec Changelog Format

```markdown
# Retry Logic Specification

## Changelog
| Date | Change | Triggered By |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 2025-01-19 | Added nested entity handling | task-3 blocked |
| 2025-01-17 | Initial version | goal creation |
```

## Multi-Sprint Lifecycle

Liza supports multiple sprints within a single goal. When a sprint completes and the human resumes, a new sprint is automatically created.

### Sprint Advance Trigger

On `liza resume` from CHECKPOINT, if all planned tasks are terminal:
1. Current sprint is archived to `.liza/archive/sprint-N.yaml`
2. A lightweight `SprintSummary` is recorded in `state.sprint_history`
3. A new sprint is created with `Number = previous + 1`
4. Non-terminal tasks (e.g., READY, IMPLEMENTING, BLOCKED) are carried into the new sprint's `scope.planned`
5. The planner then detects work to do (carried tasks or INITIAL_PLANNING if none)

If resumed from CHECKPOINT but planned tasks are NOT all terminal (mid-sprint manual checkpoint), the same sprint continues as IN_PROGRESS.

### Sprint Archive

Full sprint data (scope, metrics, retrospective) is archived to:
```
.liza/archive/sprint-N.yaml
```

State.yaml keeps only `sprint_history[]` — lightweight summaries for quick reference:
```yaml
sprint_history:
  - id: sprint-1
    number: 1
    status: COMPLETED
    started: 2025-01-17T09:00:00Z
    ended: 2025-01-19T14:00:00Z
    tasks_done: 4
```

### Task Carry-Forward

Non-terminal tasks automatically carry into the new sprint's planned scope. This includes:
- READY, IMPLEMENTING, READY_FOR_REVIEW, REVIEWING, REJECTED, BLOCKED, DRAFT, INTEGRATION_FAILED

Terminal tasks (MERGED, ABANDONED, SUPERSEDED) are generally NOT carried forward, with one exception:

**Planning tasks with unconsumed output:** MERGED tasks that belong to a planning role-pair (e.g., `code-planning-pair`), have non-empty `output[]`, and have no `transitions_executed` are carried forward. These tasks have planning output that the orchestrator has not yet expanded into child tasks via PLANNING_COMPLETE. Without carry-forward, the new sprint would have an empty planned scope and the orchestrator would idle indefinitely.

## Blackboard Sprint Section

```yaml
sprint:
  id: sprint-1
  number: 1
  goal_ref: goal-1
  scope:
    planned: [task-1, task-2, task-3, task-4, task-5]
    stretch: [task-6]
  timeline:

    tasks_in_progress: 1
    tasks_blocked: 1
    iterations_total: 23
    review_cycles_total: 6
  retrospective: null
```

### Metrics Definitions

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| `tasks_done` | Count of tasks with status IN (MERGED, ABANDONED, SUPERSEDED) |
| `tasks_in_progress` | Count of tasks with status IN (IMPLEMENTING, READY_FOR_REVIEW, REJECTED) |
| `tasks_blocked` | Count of tasks with status = BLOCKED |
| `review_verdict_approvals` | Count of `approved` events across task histories |
| `review_verdict_rejections` | Count of `rejected` events across task histories |
| `review_verdict_count` | `review_verdict_approvals + review_verdict_rejections` |
| `review_verdict_approval_rate_percent` | `review_verdict_approvals / review_verdict_count * 100` |
| `task_submitted_for_review_count` | Count of `ready_for_review` events across task histories |
| `task_outcome_approval_rate_percent` | `review_verdict_approvals / task_submitted_for_review_count * 100` |
