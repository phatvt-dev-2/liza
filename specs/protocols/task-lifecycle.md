# Task Lifecycle Protocol

## Overview

Tasks flow through a lifecycle managed by Planner, Coder, and Code Reviewer roles. Each transition has explicit triggers and validation requirements.

For state diagrams and valid transitions, see [State Machines](../architecture/state-machines.md).

## Task Type and Role Workflow

> **Note:** The `task.type` field and static type registry described below reflect the current
> hardcoded system. The [Sub-pipelines spec](../build/2%20-%20Sub-pipelines and spec writing.md) replaces this
> mechanism with the `role_pair` field, which links tasks to their role-pair in the pipeline
> config for claimability and state resolution. The `type` field may remain as a human-readable
> category but will no longer drive role dispatch.

Each task has a `type` field that determines which roles participate in its lifecycle. The type maps to an ordered role workflow via a static registry:

| Type | Workflow | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `coding` (default) | coder → code_reviewer | Standard code implementation with review |

When the `type` field is empty, it defaults to `"coding"` for backward compatibility. Unknown types are rejected by `liza validate`.

The task type is set by the Planner during task creation (via `liza_add_tasks` or `liza add-task --type`). Coders and Code Reviewers can only claim tasks whose type includes their role in the workflow.

See [State Machines — Type-Aware Claimability](../architecture/state-machines.md#type-aware-claimability) for the formal claimability rule.

## Iteration Protocol

### Ralph-Style Loop

Coder iterates until externally approved:

```
while task.state != APPROVED and iterations < max_iterations:
    extend_lease()
    work on task
    log_anomalies_as_they_occur()  # see roles.md for required types
    if ready:
        ensure_clean_git_status()
        record_commit_sha()
        request_review()
        # Wait model: exit and let supervisor restart
        exit(42)  # supervisor restarts; on restart, re-read blackboard for verdict

# After restart, check verdict:
if task.state == REJECTED:
    read feedback
    iterations++
    # continue loop on next restart

if iterations >= max_iterations and task.state != APPROVED:
    mark_blocked("max iterations reached without approval")
    exit(42)
```

**Wait Model:** Agents do not block waiting for verdicts. After requesting review, the coder exits with code 42. The supervisor restarts the agent, which re-reads the blackboard to discover the verdict. This stateless restart model is fundamental to Liza's design.

**Logging:** Coder MUST log anomalies as they occur (not at end of task). See [Roles](../architecture/roles.md#coder-logging-duties) for required anomaly types.

### Iteration Limits

| Role | Default Max | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Coder | 10 | Enough for complex tasks, bounded |
| Code Reviewer | 1 per review | Review should be decisive |
| Review cycles | 5 | Coder-Code Reviewer loop cap |

### Early Warning Thresholds

`liza watch` alerts before limits are hit (trajectory visibility):

| Metric | Warning | Cliff | Condition |
|--------|---------|-------|-----------|
| Coder iterations | 8 | 10 | Always |
| Review cycles | 3 | 5 | Always |
| Coder failures | 1 | 2 | Only if review_cycles ≥ 3 |

The third condition avoids noise on isolated recoverable failures — a single coder failure with few review cycles is likely recoverable.

## Hypothesis Exhaustion Rule

If same task is BLOCKED by two different coders:

1. Task framing presumed wrong
2. Task cannot be reassigned unchanged
3. Planner must: rescope (→ SUPERSEDED), split, or abandon
4. Planner must identify and record root cause before rescoping; include it in `rescope_reason` and the log entry.

This prevents infinite polite failure.

Tracked via:
```yaml
tasks:
  - id: task-3
    failed_by:
      - coder-1  # first failure
      - coder-2  # second failure → hypothesis exhaustion
```

---

## Rescoping Audit Trail

When planner rescopes a blocked task:

1. Original task → `SUPERSEDED`
2. New task(s) created with:
   - `supersedes: [original-task-id]`
   - `rescope_reason: [root cause + rationale — ambiguity | missing dependency | architecture mismatch | invalid assumption | ...]`
3. Log entry records the rescope
4. Log entry includes a one-sentence root cause (what failed and why).

Original task history is preserved. No silent rewrites.

---

## Blocked Escalation

| Condition | Escalation |
|-----------|------------|
| Coder BLOCKED | Planner notified, may rescope |
| Code Reviewer and Coder deadlocked (5 cycles) | Planner intervenes (see Review Deadlock Protocol) |
| Integration failed | Task reclaimable with integration-fix scope |
| Two coders failed same task | Hypothesis exhaustion → mandatory rescope |

### Review Budget Exhaustion Protocol

When Coder and Code Reviewer reach `max_review_cycles` (default: 5) without approval:

1. **Task transitions to BLOCKED** with `blocked_reason: "review_budget_exhausted"`
2. **Planner evaluates** the rejection/revision history:

| Planner Assessment | Action |
|--------------------|--------|
| Coder not addressing feedback | Reassign to different coder (preserves worktree) |
| Code Reviewer criteria unclear/shifting | Clarify spec, reset review_cycles, same coder continues |
| Genuine disagreement on approach | Rescope task with clearer constraints |
| Task fundamentally misframed | SUPERSEDED, create replacement task(s) |
| No viable path forward | ABANDONED (requires rationale in log) |

3. **Planner must log** `review_budget_exhausted` anomaly with assessment
4. **Work is NOT discarded** unless Planner explicitly chooses ABANDONED after assessment

**Key invariant:** The Coder-Code Reviewer loop runs to completion (5 cycles) before any intervention. No premature escalation.

### Integration-Fix Protocol

When merge fails (INTEGRATION_FAILED):

1. **Any coder may claim** — not restricted to original coder
2. **Worktree is reused** — contains the conflicting state
3. **Claimer must set** `integration_fix: true` on claim
4. **Scope is limited** — resolve conflict only, no new features
5. **After resolution** — normal review cycle applies

```bash
# Claim integration-fix task
liza claim-task task-3 coder-2
```

---

## Scope Discipline

### Task Scope is Hard Boundary

- Work only on claimed task
- No modifications outside task scope, even if "obviously needed"
- No "while I'm here" fixes
- No prerequisite work unless explicitly part of task

### Discovery Protocol

If coder discovers adjacent problem:

1. Do not fix
2. Log to blackboard as potential new task:

```yaml
discovered:
  - id: disc-1
    by: coder-1
    during: task-3
    description: "API client has no timeout, could hang indefinitely"
    severity: high
    recommendation: "New task: add configurable timeout"
```

3. Continue with original task

Planner decides whether to create new task.

## Context Exhaustion Handoff

At 90% context capacity:

1. STOP at next safe point (not mid-edit)
2. Commit any pending changes
3. Write structured handoff to blackboard:

```yaml
handoff:
  task: task-3
  agent: coder-1
  context_used: 92%
  timestamp: 2025-01-17T15:00:00Z
  # REQUIRED (1 phrase max each — degraded agent can still produce this)
  summary: "Implementing retry logic, core mechanism done"
  next_action: "Add exponential backoff for 429 responses"
  # OPTIONAL (include if context allows)
  approach: "Using tenacity library. Decorator pattern."
  blockers: "Edge case: API returns 429 with Retry-After"
  files_modified:
    - src/api/client.py
    - tests/test_client.py
  next_steps:
    - Add exponential backoff
    - Handle 429 with Retry-After header
```

### Handoff Field Requirements

| Field | Required | Constraint | Rationale |
|-------|----------|------------|-----------|
| `summary` | Yes | 1 phrase max | What state is the task in? |
| `next_action` | Yes | 1 phrase max | What should replacement do first? |
| `approach` | No | — | How was it being implemented? |
| `blockers` | No | — | What's blocking progress? |
| `files_modified` | No | — | Which files were touched? |
| `next_steps` | No | — | Remaining work items |

**Rationale:** An agent at 90% context is degraded but can still produce two phrases. Required fields bound the minimum viable handoff; optional fields capture richer context when available. This doesn't solve degradation but bounds its impact on handoff quality.

4. Set `handoff_pending: true` on task in blackboard
5. Exit with code 42
6. Supervisor restarts agent process (fresh context)
7. On startup, agent checks task's `handoff_pending` flag:
   - If `true` AND agent ID matches handoff → clear flag, read handoff, resume
   - If `true` AND agent ID differs → this is the replacement agent, read handoff, claim task
   - If `false` → normal startup (context exhaustion was for different reason)

**Note:** "Fresh agent" means fresh LLM context, not necessarily different agent ID. The supervisor restarts the same agent process; whether it's the "same" agent depends on whether handoff was to self or replacement.

### Context Tracking (v1 Limitation)

Claude Code does not expose token usage programmatically. The `context_percent` field in the blackboard is aspirational for v1.

**v1 Approach: Iteration Proxy**

Instead of measuring context, agents use iteration count as proxy for context pressure:

- After N iterations on a single task without resolution → consider handoff
- If response quality degrades noticeably → initiate handoff
- Agent self-reports: "Context feels constrained, initiating handoff"

The 90% trigger becomes heuristic, not measured:
- Many tool calls in sequence
- Repeated re-reading of same files
- Difficulty holding task state

**Handoff remains mandatory behavior.** The trigger is approximate.

## Session Initialization

### Human Bootstrap Sequence

Before agents can run, human must initialize the project:

1. **Write goal spec:** Create a goal specification document
   - Default location: `specs/vision.md` (copy from `templates/vision-template.md`)
   - Alternative: Use a custom path for feature-specific goals
   - Fill in goal context and success criteria
   - Planner cannot decompose goal without this document

2. **Initialize Liza state:** `liza init "Goal description" --spec [spec_ref]`
   - `spec_ref` defaults to `specs/vision.md` if not provided
   - Requires the spec file to exist at the specified path
   - Creates `.liza/` directory structure
   - Creates `state.yaml` with goal (including `spec_ref`) and sprint initialized
   - Creates `log.yaml`

3. **Start watcher:** `liza watch` in separate terminal
   - Monitors for CHECKPOINT, anomalies, circuit breaker triggers

4. **Start agents:** Launch Planner, then Coders/Code Reviewers as needed
   - Each in separate terminal for observation

### Agent Startup Sequence

1. Read `~/.liza/CORE.md` → symlink to `<project>/contracts/CORE.md`
2. CORE.md contains universal rules and mode selection
3. State: `"Mode: Liza [role]"` (Planner/Coder/Code Reviewer)
4. Read `contracts/MULTI_AGENT_MODE.md` (Liza-specific rules)
5. Read project context: `REPOSITORY.md`, `specs/`, relevant docs
6. Read `.liza/state.yaml`
7. Check for PAUSE/ABORT/CHECKPOINT files → if found, exit(42) immediately
8. Read `human_notes` if present
9. **Verify lease if resuming task** — abort if lease lost
10. Read `handoff` notes if present for assigned task
11. Role-specific initialization (below)
12. Announce ready: `"[Role] ready. Reading blackboard."`

### Planner Initialization

1. Read specs to understand goal context
2. If no goal defined: exit(42) — human must define goal via bootstrap sequence
3. If goal defined but no tasks: decompose into tasks (write as DRAFT first)
4. Verify specs exist for tasks; if not, flag for human
5. Finalize DRAFT → READY when plan complete
6. If tasks exist: monitor for blocked/escalation conditions
7. Write initial goal-alignment summary

### Coder Initialization

**Note:** The supervisor (`liza agent`) claims tasks and creates worktrees BEFORE spawning the coder. The coder receives its assigned task in the bootstrap prompt.

1. Extract task ID and worktree path from bootstrap prompt
2. Verify assignment in state.yaml (status IMPLEMENTING, assigned_to matches self)
3. Read the **full task entry** from blackboard (all fields: description, done_when, scope, iteration, rejection_reason, etc.)
4. Read specs relevant to task (using task's `spec_ref`)
5. **For iteration 2+:** Read and address prior `rejection_reason` (extracted into prompt by supervisor)
6. If task under-specified (no clear spec) → BLOCKED with clarifying questions (see [Blocking Protocol](../architecture/roles.md#blocking-protocol))
7. Enter worktree, begin iteration loop

### Code Reviewer Initialization

**Note:** The supervisor (`liza agent`) assigns review tasks BEFORE spawning the reviewer. The reviewer receives its assigned task in the bootstrap prompt.

1. Extract review task ID and worktree path from bootstrap prompt
2. Verify assignment in state.yaml (status READY_FOR_REVIEW, reviewing_by matches self)
3. Verify commit SHA matches worktree HEAD
4. Read the **full task entry** from blackboard (all fields including prior `rejection_reason` for iteration 2+)
5. Read specs relevant to task (using task's `spec_ref`)
6. Examine worktree, validate against spec and `done_when` criteria, run validations, produce verdict
7. **For iteration 2+:** Compare current submission against prior rejection — report which issues are RESOLVED, STILL PRESENT, or PARTIAL
8. On approval: execute merge
