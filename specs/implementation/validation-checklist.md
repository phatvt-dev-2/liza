# Validation Checklist

Before declaring v1 complete:

## Spec Readiness (Pre-Implementation Gate)

Before implementation begins, spec review must reach verdict:

| Verdict | Meaning | Criteria |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **APPROVED** | Ready for implementation | No Critical, no High |
| **CONDITIONAL** | Proceed with tracked items | No Critical; High items have explicit acceptance rationale |
| **BLOCKED** | Cannot proceed | Critical exists or High affects foundational assumptions |

### Stopping Criteria

Review concludes when ANY of:
1. Verdict is APPROVED
2. Two consecutive passes find no new Critical/High
3. Human declares "good enough" with explicit acceptance

### Issue Handling

| Severity | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Critical | Must fix before implementation |
| High | Must fix or explicitly accept with rationale |
| Medium | Fix if touched, otherwise track |
| Low | Document only |

**Current verdict:** ____________

## Supervision

---

## Human Override

- [ ] PAUSE halts all agents

---

## Sprint Governance

---

## Circuit Breaker

- [ ] Anomalies section in blackboard schema
- [ ] Coders log retry_loop anomalies

---

## Anomaly Logging

- [ ] Coder logs retry_loop (> 2 iterations same error)
- [ ] Coder logs trade_off (suboptimal accepted)
- [ ] Coder logs spec_ambiguity (interpretation required)
- [ ] Coder logs external_blocker (external dependency)
- [ ] Coder logs assumption_violated (spec assumption false)
- [ ] Code Reviewer logs retry_loop (if not already logged by coder)
- [ ] Code Reviewer logs scope_deviation (work differs from spec)
- [ ] Code Reviewer logs workaround (bypass detected)
- [ ] Code Reviewer logs debt_created (technical debt)
- [ ] Code Reviewer logs assumption_violated (spec assumption contradicted)
- [ ] Planner logs hypothesis_exhaustion (two coders failed same task)
- [ ] Planner logs spec_gap (missing spec discovered)
- [ ] Logging happens at time of occurrence
