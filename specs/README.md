## Reading Order

**For understanding the system:**
1. [Vision](<build/1 - Vision.md>) — philosophy and rationale
2. [Product Description](<functional/1 - Liza.md>) — what Liza is today
3. [Architecture Overview](architecture/overview.md) — components and flow
4. [Roles](architecture/roles.md) — who does what
5. [Task Lifecycle](protocols/task-lifecycle.md) — how work flows

**For implementation:**
1. [Blackboard Schema](architecture/blackboard-schema.md) — data structures
2. [Tooling](implementation/tooling.md) — scripts and interfaces
3. [Phases](implementation/phases.md) — build order

**For operations:**
1. [Sprint Governance](protocols/sprint-governance.md) — checkpoints and retrospectives
2. [Circuit Breaker](protocols/circuit-breaker.md) — failure detection
3. [Validation Checklist](implementation/validation-checklist.md) — completeness check

## Key Concepts

### Four Pillars

1. **Behavioral contracts** — Tier 0 invariants turn agents into accountable peers
2. **Externally validated completion** — Coders cannot self-certify; Code Reviewers approve
3. **Specification system** — specs persist understanding across agent restarts
4. **Blackboard coordination** — all state visible through shared file

### Design Philosophy

See [Vision](<build/1 - Vision.md>) for the design philosophy and cost gradient.

## Maintenance Notes

### Agent Prompt Templates

Operational reference content (blackboard fields, state machine, anomaly types, etc.) is inlined directly into agent prompts via Go templates in `internal/prompts/templates/`. The key templates are:

| Template | Content |
|----------|---------|
| `shared_reference.tmpl` | Shared operational content (state machine, blackboard fields, anomaly types, lease model, exit codes) |
| `planner_context.tmpl` | Planner logging duties, self-validation gates, field format guidelines |
| `coder_context.tmpl` | Coder logging duties, blocking protocol |
| `reviewer_context.tmpl` | Reviewer logging duties, review scope, approval semantics |

**Sync requirement:** When updating these specs, check if the prompt templates need corresponding updates:

| Spec | Templates affected |
|------|-------------------|
| `roles.md` | Role-specific templates (planner/coder/reviewer_context.tmpl) |
| `blackboard-schema.md` | `shared_reference.tmpl` field tables |
| `state-machines.md` | `shared_reference.tmpl` state transitions |
| `task-lifecycle.md` | `shared_reference.tmpl` + role templates |

The specs contain rationale and design context; the templates contain only what agents need to act.

**Trade-off:** Templates are compiled into the binary. Updating operational content requires `make build` → reinstall → restart agents. This higher deployment friction was accepted to eliminate the failure mode where agents skip reading a deployed reference file.
