      summary: |
        Initial alignment: 5 API endpoints need retry logic.
        Approach: tenacity library with exponential backoff.
    - timestamp: 2025-01-17T16:30:00Z
      event: rescope_task-4
      summary: |
        Current: Basic retry decorator implemented for 2/5 API endpoints.
        Change: task-4 split into auth/validation subtasks (scope was too broad).
        Remaining: 3 endpoints, exponential backoff config, integration tests.
        Risk: None identified.

### Iteration Field Lifecycle

The `iteration` field tracks coder work cycles on a task:

| Event | `iteration` Value |
|-------|-------------------|
| Task created (DRAFT/READY) | Not set (null) |
| First claim (READY → IMPLEMENTING) | Set to 1 |
| Work iteration complete | Unchanged (work within single claim) |
| Review rejected (REJECTED → IMPLEMENTING, same coder) | Increment by 1 |
| Task reassigned (different coder) | Reset to 1 |
| Task reaches terminal state | Preserved (audit trail) |

**Semantics:**
- `iteration` counts **claim cycles**, not internal work loops
- A coder may make multiple commits within one iteration
- Incrementing happens when the coder re-claims after rejection
- The field supports limit enforcement (`max_iterations`) and trajectory tracking

**Relationship to `review_cycles_current`:**
- `iteration`: How many times the coder has worked on this task
- `review_cycles_current`: How many times the coder has been rejected

These can differ: a coder might submit multiple reviews in one iteration (if they split work), or iterate multiple times before requesting review.

### Review Cycles Split

Tasks track two review cycle counters:

| Field | Reset on Reassign | Purpose |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| `review_cycles_current` | Yes (→ 0) | Limit check — new coder gets full budget |
| `review_cycles_total` | No | Audit trail — total rejections across all coders |

**Rationale:** Difficult tasks requiring coder reassignment should not penalize the replacement coder with inherited review budget. A task reassigned after 3 rejections would otherwise leave only 2 cycles before deadlock, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy that reassigned tasks require rescoping.

**Limit checks use `review_cycles_current`; retrospectives use `review_cycles_total`.**

### Rejection Reason Format

The `rejection_reason` field uses a structured format derived from the code-review skill:

```yaml
rejection_reason: |
  Blockers: [count]
  - [blocker] file:line — Issue description
    Why it matters: [impact]
    Suggestion: [fix]

  Concerns: [count]
  - [concern] file:line — Issue description

  Overall: [1-2 sentence assessment]

  Prior Feedback Status:  # Required for iteration 2+
  - RESOLVED: [issues from prior rejection now fixed]
  - STILL PRESENT: [issues not addressed]
  - PARTIAL: [issues partially addressed]
```

**Requirements:**
- Blockers and Concerns must reference specific `file:line` locations
- Each issue must include actionable suggestion
- For iteration 2+: Prior Feedback Status section is mandatory

**Rationale:** Structured format enables:
- Coder to address specific locations rather than interpreting prose
- Reviewer to track feedback continuity across iterations
- Watcher to detect oscillation patterns (issue flip-flopping between RESOLVED and STILL PRESENT)

**History tracking:** Rejection events in task history include the full `reason` field for audit trail:
```yaml
history:
  - { time: "...", event: "rejected", agent: "code-reviewer-1", reason: "Blockers: 1\n- [blocker] ..." }
```

### Task Dependencies

The `depends_on` field declares explicit dependencies between tasks:

```yaml
- id: task-auth
  status: READY
  depends_on: []  # No dependencies

- id: task-validation
  status: READY
  depends_on: [task-auth]  # Blocked until task-auth is MERGED
```

**Semantics:**
- `depends_on` is an array of task IDs that must reach MERGED status before this task can be claimed
- Empty array or missing field means no dependencies — task is immediately claimable
- Coders can only claim tasks where ALL dependencies are satisfied
- Planner sets dependencies during task creation based on logical ordering

**Claimability Rule:**
```
claimable = (status in [READY, REJECTED, INTEGRATION_FAILED]) AND (depends_on is empty OR all depends_on tasks are MERGED)
```

- **READY**: Fresh task ready for first attempt
- **REJECTED**: Code review failed; coder can reclaim to address feedback
- **INTEGRATION_FAILED**: Merge failed; coder can reclaim to resolve conflicts

**Why explicit dependencies?**
- Without explicit dependencies, Coders discover blockers at runtime → scattered BLOCKED tasks
- Planner has context to identify dependencies during decomposition
- Explicit dependencies enable parallel work on independent tasks
- Dependencies surface the critical path for human visibility

**Dependency vs BLOCKED:**
- `depends_on`: Known at planning time — task waits automatically
- `BLOCKED`: Discovered at runtime — requires Planner intervention

    converted_to_task: null  # Planner evaluates: task, "deferred" (→ ISSUES_FILE), or "dismissed"

**Discovery Fields:**

| Field | Values | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `source` | `null` / omitted | Implementation discovery (default — found during coding) |
| | `systemic-thinking` | Analytical finding from systemic review (typically by Code Reviewer) |
| `severity` | `critical` | Blocks current task; must address before continuing |
| | `high` | Significant issue; should address soon |
| | `medium` | Notable finding; address when convenient |
| | `low` | Nice-to-have; log for future consideration |
| `urgency` | `immediate` | Wakes Planner now (for critical blockers) |
| | `deferred` | Planner reviews at next planning cycle (default) |
| `converted_to_task` | `null` | Not yet evaluated by Planner |
| | `task-N` | Planner created task to address |
| | `deferred` | Planner wrote to ISSUES_FILE — acknowledged, not actionable now |
| | `dismissed` | Planner evaluated and dismissed — no action warranted |

**Usage:** Coders encountering nice-to-haves during implementation log them with `severity: low, urgency: deferred` rather than blocking or scope-creeping. Code Reviewers invoking the systemic-thinking skill log findings with `source: systemic-thinking` (see skill for severity mapping).

  ```
- If task field is absent, config default applies
- Other config values (`heartbeat_interval`, `lease_duration`) are not per-task overridable

## Lease Model

Agents hold **leases**, not just heartbeats. Lease = "I own this task until time X."

```yaml
agents:
  coder-1:
    role: coder
    current_task: task-3
    lease_expires: 2025-01-17T14:35:00Z
    heartbeat: 2025-01-17T14:32:00Z
    terminal: /dev/pts/2
```

**Lease rules:**
- On claim: set `lease_expires` to now + lease_duration (default: 5 minutes)
- Heartbeat extends lease by lease_duration
- Task reclaimable only after lease expires
- If original agent returns after expiry → must self-abort immediately

**Lease and Review States:**
- Coder lease (`lease_expires`) governs IMPLEMENTING state only
- When task transitions to READY_FOR_REVIEW, the coder's lease becomes inactive
- Supervisor assigns review by setting `reviewing_by` and `review_lease_expires` before spawning Code Reviewer
- If Code Reviewer crashes, review lease expires and supervisor can assign to another Code Reviewer
- Task in APPROVED or REJECTED has no active lease requirement
- If review is REJECTED, supervisor re-claims for the original coder (acquiring a new lease) to resume work

**Code Reviewer Lease Fields (READY_FOR_REVIEW only):**

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `reviewing_by` | Agent ID of Code Reviewer currently examining (null if unclaimed) |
| `review_lease_expires` | Code Reviewer lease expiry timestamp (same mechanics as coder lease) |
| `approved_by` | Agent ID of Code Reviewer who approved the task (null until approved) |
| `merge_commit` | Integration branch commit SHA created by merge (null until merged) |

Code Reviewer lease prevents two Code Reviewers examining same task simultaneously and enables recovery from Code Reviewer crash.

**Heartbeat interval:** 60 seconds
**Lease duration:** 300 seconds (5 minutes)
**Stale threshold:** lease_expires in the past

This resolves "slow but alive" ambiguity cleanly.

**v1 Limitation — Long Operations:**

The lease model assumes agents can interleave heartbeats with work. Some operations are atomic and cannot yield:
- Test suites running >5 minutes
- Large git operations (rebase, merge with conflicts)
- Complex refactors requiring sustained context

If an agent runs a 6-minute test suite without heartbeating, its lease expires mid-operation. Another agent may reclaim the task, creating a race.

**Mitigations for v1:**
1. **Pre-operation lease extension:** Before starting known-long operations, heartbeat immediately to maximize remaining time
2. **Task-level long_operation flag:** Mark tasks that require extended lease (human configures `lease_duration_override`)
3. **Watcher grace period:** Watcher delays reclaim alerts by 60s after lease expiry (allows in-flight operations to complete)

**v2 Solution:** Background heartbeat thread in Claude Code integration, or operation-aware lease that extends automatically during tool execution.

## Locking

All writes to `state.yaml` use `flock`:

```bash
flock -x .liza/state.yaml.lock -c 'operation'
```

Lock hold time must be minimal (read, modify, write, release).

Reads do not require lock (eventual consistency acceptable for reads).

---

## Operations

| Operation | Actor | Procedure |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Claim task | Supervisor | Two-phase: validate under lock → create worktree → re-validate and commit under lock (see tooling.md) |
| Extend lease | Any | Lock → update heartbeat + lease_expires → unlock |
| Request review | Coder | Lock → verify clean git status → write commit SHA + set READY_FOR_REVIEW atomically → unlock |
| Claim review | Supervisor | Lock → verify READY_FOR_REVIEW → set REVIEWING + write reviewing_by + review_lease_expires → unlock |
| Extend review lease | Code Reviewer | Lock → update review_lease_expires → unlock |
| Submit verdict | Code Reviewer | Lock → verify REVIEWING + commit SHA matches + reviewing_by matches self → set APPROVED/REJECTED + reason + set approved_by on approval + clear review lease → unlock |
| Execute merge | Supervisor | After Code Reviewer sets APPROVED → supervisor runs `liza wt-merge` → update state to MERGED |
| Mark blocked | Any | Lock → set state BLOCKED + diagnosis → unlock |
| Rescope task | Planner | Lock → set original SUPERSEDED → create new task(s) with reference → unlock |
| Finalize draft | Planner | Lock → change DRAFT to READY → unlock |
| Log activity | Any | Append to log.yaml (no lock needed, append-only) |

---

## Clean Sync Invariant

Before setting READY_FOR_REVIEW, coder must ensure working tree is clean:

```bash
[ -z "$(git -C $WORKTREE status --porcelain)" ] || abort "Uncommitted changes"
COMMIT_SHA=$(git -C $WORKTREE rev-parse HEAD)
```

Blackboard records `review_commit: $COMMIT_SHA`. Code Reviewer verifies this SHA before reviewing.

For detailed definition including edge cases (submodules, untracked files), see [Worktree Management — Clean Sync Invariant](../protocols/worktree-management.md#clean-sync-invariant).

## Validation Rules

### Anomaly Types

| Type | Logged By | When to Log |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `retry_loop` | Coder, Code Reviewer | Same error pattern across >2 iterations |
| `trade_off` | Coder | Accepted suboptimal solution to unblock progress |
| `spec_ambiguity` | Coder | Spec doesn't cover encountered case, judgment call made |
| `external_blocker` | Coder | External service/API blocking progress |
| `assumption_violated` | Coder, Code Reviewer | Spec assumption proven false by implementation |
| `scope_deviation` | Code Reviewer | Implementation differs from task spec |
| `workaround` | Code Reviewer | Shortcut taken instead of proper fix |
| `debt_created` | Code Reviewer | Technical debt introduced |
| `spec_changed` | Code Reviewer | Spec changed since task creation |
| `hypothesis_exhaustion` | Planner | Two coders failed same task, rescope required |
| `spec_gap` | Planner | Missing spec discovered during planning/rescope |
| `review_deadlock` | Planner | Coder-Code Reviewer reached max cycles without approval |
| `review_exhaustion` | Planner | Two reviewers failed to issue verdict on same task |
| `reviewer_loop` | Code Reviewer | Reviewer stuck in command loop, self-aborted |
| `system_ambiguity` | Any role | Liza protocol or role definition unclear, escalated to Planner |

**Required Details Fields (validated by `liza validate`):**

| Type | Required Fields | Purpose |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| `retry_loop` | `count`, `error_pattern` | Pattern detection via `similar(error_pattern)` |
| `trade_off` | `what`, `why`, `debt_created` | Debt accumulation counting |
| `external_blocker` | `blocker_service` | Aggregation by service for circuit breaker |
| `assumption_violated` | `assumption`, `reality` | Assumption cascade detection |
| `reviewer_loop` | `count`, `command_pattern` | Reviewer self-abort on repetitive commands |
| `review_exhaustion` | `reviewers_failed`, `common_blocker` | Two reviewers failed to complete review |
| `system_ambiguity` | `protocol_section`, `question` | Track Liza system gaps for human clarification |

Anomalies with malformed details will fail validation. This ensures circuit breaker pattern detection has reliable data.
The agent should be very specific about the faced issue so this may be reproduced and investigated.

  - "IMPLEMENTING task must have all depends_on tasks in MERGED status"
  - "Agent WORKING must have task"
  - "Agent WORKING should have lease_expires in future (warning if expired beyond grace period of 60s — may indicate long-running operation)"
  - "No two agents assigned to same task"
  - "Task with integration_fix:true must have prior INTEGRATION_FAILED in history"
  - "Task failed_by list must contain unique agent IDs"
  - "Anomaly type must be one of: retry_loop, trade_off, spec_ambiguity, external_blocker, assumption_violated, scope_deviation, workaround, debt_created, spec_changed, hypothesis_exhaustion, spec_gap, review_deadlock, review_exhaustion, reviewer_loop, system_ambiguity"
  # Transition invariants (runtime-enforced, not statically validated)
  # These are enforced by agent behavior and atomic operations during state transitions.
  # `liza validate` validates static state invariants; these require history analysis.
  - "IMPLEMENTING task from REJECTED must have new lease_expires (not stale from prior claim)"
  - "READY task must preserve failed_by if previously BLOCKED"
  - "IMPLEMENTING task with integration_fix:true must have lease_expires set"
```

**Enforcement Note:** Static invariants (above the "Transition invariants" comment) are validated by `liza validate`. Transition invariants are runtime constraints enforced by agents performing atomic operations during state transitions — they cannot be verified post-hoc without history event analysis.
