# 31 - Configurable Post-Worktree Command

## Context and Problem Statement

Agent worktrees for Go projects failed builds because embedded assets (e.g., `internal/embedded/claude-settings.json`) were missing. The initial fix hardcoded `make sync-embedded` in `CreateWorktree()`, but this prevented Liza from working on another project than itself.

The problem surfaced when agent log analysis revealed ~7 wasted turns per session where agents tried to diagnose and work around the missing assets, often blocked by sandbox permissions.

## Considered Options

1. **Auto-detect build system** — unreliable across language ecosystems.
2. **Configurable hook** — user specifies the command at `liza init` time.

## Decision Outcome

Chose **Option 2**: replace the hardcoded call with a configurable `PostWorktreeCmd` field.

### Architecture

**Config schema** (`state.yaml`):
```yaml
config:
  post_worktree_cmd: "make sync-embedded"  # nil if not specified
```

**CLI surface:**
```
liza init --post-worktree-cmd "make sync-embedded"
```

**Execution model:**
- Command runs via `sh -c` in the worktree directory
- `RunPostWorktreeCmd()` is idempotent — safe on both new and existing worktrees
- Failures produce warnings, never block task claiming (permissive strategy)
- Applied at all worktree creation points: direct creation, task claim, recovery, rejection reclaims

**Trust model:** Same boundary as Makefile/CI config — write access to `state.yaml` equals write access to the repository.

**Key files:**
- `internal/models/state.go` — `Config.PostWorktreeCmd *string`
- `internal/ops/wt_create.go` — `RunPostWorktreeCmd()` + hook calls
- `internal/ops/claim_task.go` — post-command after worktree provisioning
- `internal/agent/worktree_check.go` — reviewer worktree recovery

### Rationale

Agents should not waste turns on problems that can be solved deterministically via configuration. The permissive failure strategy (warn, don't block) reflects the current operational approach: let agents proceed and analyze logs in batches for systemic issues.

### Implementation Notes

The decision also triggered GUARDRAILS.md rule G1.1 (ADR-0032), which codifies the broader principle: no Liza-specific hardcoding in runtime code.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Liza becomes stack-agnostic — works for any language/framework
- Eliminates ~7 wasted agent turns per session on Go projects
- Single configuration point for project-specific worktree setup

**Limitations accepted:**
- User must know to set the flag at init time
- Command failures are silent (by design) — requires log analysis to detect
