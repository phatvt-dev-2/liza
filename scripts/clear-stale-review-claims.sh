# Clear stale review claims on READY_FOR_REVIEW tasks
# Usage: clear-stale-review-claims.sh [project_root]
#
# When a Code Reviewer crashes mid-review, reviewing_by and review_lease_expires
# remain set. This script clears expired claims so other reviewers can claim the task.
#
# Typically called by:
# - Code Reviewer supervisor on startup
# - Periodically by cron or monitoring
# - liza-watch.sh could call this (though watch shouldn't mutate state by default)
