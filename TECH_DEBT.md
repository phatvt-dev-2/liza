## ParentTask (singular) field deprecation

**What:** `models.Task.ParentTask *string` coexists with `ParentTasks []string`. `EffectiveParentTasks()` bridges both, and `buildChildTask` writes only `ParentTasks`. But `ParentTask` remains in the struct and is populated by existing YAML state files.

**Why deferred:** Removing it requires migrating all active state files (in-flight sprints across user projects). No correctness risk while `EffectiveParentTasks()` handles both.

**Payback trigger:** When no active state files use `parent_task` (singular) — check with `grep -r "parent_task:" ~/.liza/state.yaml` across deployments. At that point, remove the field from the struct and drop the fallback branch in `EffectiveParentTasks()`.
