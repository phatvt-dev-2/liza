# Tech Debt

Deliberate debt with payback triggers. See CORE.md Rule 3 (DoD) for policy.

## ParentTask (singular) field deprecation

**What:** `models.Task.ParentTask *string` coexists with `ParentTasks []string`. `EffectiveParentTasks()` bridges both, and `buildChildTask` writes only `ParentTasks`. But `ParentTask` remains in the struct and is populated by existing YAML state files.

**Why deferred:** Removing it requires migrating all active state files (in-flight sprints across user projects). No correctness risk while `EffectiveParentTasks()` handles both.

**Payback trigger:** When no active state files use `parent_task` (singular) — check with `grep -r "parent_task:" ~/.liza/state.yaml` across deployments. At that point, remove the field from the struct and drop the fallback branch in `EffectiveParentTasks()`.

## Worktree path guard: unverified payload shapes (MultiEdit, NotebookEdit)

**What:** `internal/embedded/hooks/worktree-path-guard.sh` extracts `file_path` from the PreToolUse payload to catch `.worktrees/<id>/<id>/` duplication. For Read/Write/Edit the field name is documented. For MultiEdit and NotebookEdit it is not — as of 2026-04-17, neither tool has its PreToolUse hook schema in the public Claude Code docs.

**Current state:**
- MultiEdit: matcher IS registered in `claude-settings.json`. Best-effort coverage — if MultiEdit sends `file_path`, the hook catches the bug; if not, it silently no-ops (no false deny because the extraction returns empty). Do NOT treat as confirmed protection.
- NotebookEdit: matcher NOT registered. Less common use, and promoting MultiEdit was the lower-risk experiment.

**Why deferred:** shipping claims of coverage we haven't verified would mislead future maintainers. The asymmetry (MultiEdit registered, NotebookEdit not) is intentional — MultiEdit is a higher-probability vector for the target bug given its Edit-like semantics.

**Payback trigger:** Next time MultiEdit or NotebookEdit is invoked during an agent session, capture the raw PreToolUse payload via a temporary debug hook (e.g., `cat >> /tmp/payloads.jsonl`). Promote MultiEdit to VERIFIED or teach the script the real field name; add NotebookEdit matcher once its shape is confirmed.
