# Liza worktree pre-commit hook (two-stage chain).
#
# Stage 1 — Liza guard (check-commit-allowed):
#   Rejects commits when the task is not in a state that permits coder
#   mutations. Fail-safe: any unexpected exit code (missing subcommand,
#   panic, signal death) falls through to allow — the guard is a guard,
#   not a lock, and a crashing evaluator must never deadlock commits.
#
# Stage 2 — Project pre-commit chain:
#   When <worktree>/.pre-commit-config.yaml is present, runs `pre-commit
#   run` and propagates its real exit code. Fail-closed: a missing
#   `pre-commit` binary in this case is a loud error, not a silent skip
#   (silent skip would re-introduce the gap this chain closes).
#
# Installed by `liza wt-create` into each task worktree via:
#   git config extensions.worktreeConfig true
#   git config --worktree core.hooksPath <worktree>/.liza-hooks
#
# The absolute path to the liza binary is baked in at install time. If the
# binary is missing at commit time, the guard step is skipped (belt-and-
# braces with submit-verdict's HEAD check) but the project pre-commit
# chain still runs.
