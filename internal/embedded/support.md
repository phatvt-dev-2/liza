# Liza Support Reference

Troubleshooting reference for Liza multi-agent executions.
This file is written to `.liza/SUPPORT.md` during `liza init`.

## Diagnostic Commands

```bash
liza status                        # Dashboard: goal, sprint, agents, task summary
liza get tasks                     # All tasks with current state
liza get tasks --format table      # Tabular view
liza get agents                    # Registered agents and lease status
liza validate                      # Check blackboard against invariants
liza analyze                       # Circuit breaker pattern detection
```

## Recovery Commands

```bash
liza recover-task <task-id>        # Release claim + remove worktree/branch
liza recover-agent <agent-id>      # Release claim + remove worktree + delete agent
liza release-claim <task-id>       # Granular: release claim only
liza clear-stale-review-claims     # Clear all expired review leases
liza delete agent <id>             # Remove agent from state
liza delete task <id>              # Remove task from state
```

## System Control

```bash
liza pause                         # Pause all agents (sets CHECKPOINT)
liza resume                        # Resume or advance sprint (see Sprint Lifecycle)
liza stop                          # Abort system
liza sprint-checkpoint             # Force checkpoint (halt + summary)
liza replan [task-id]              # Invalidate planner output, create new planning task
liza proceed <task-id> <transition> # Create child tasks for next role-pair
```

## Pipeline Structure

Tasks flow through role-pairs organized in sub-pipelines. The project's frozen pipeline is in `.liza/pipeline.yaml` — inspect it for actual role-pairs, transitions, and state names.

Transitions with `trigger: manual` are human gates; `trigger: auto` transitions run without one. Use `liza status` to see currently available manual transitions.

### Transition Cardinalities

Each transition in `.liza/pipeline.yaml` has a `cardinality`:

| Cardinality | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| `per-subtask` | One child task per `output[]` entry |
| `one-to-one` | Single child task from parent |
| `many-to-one` | All sibling tasks in cohort must reach approved, then one child linking all parents |

### `liza proceed`

Creates child tasks based on a completed task's `output[]` and the transition's cardinality. After proceed, run `liza resume` to start the next sprint.

```bash
liza proceed <task-id> <transition-name>
```

Transition names appear under `transitions:` within each sub-pipeline and under the top-level `pipeline-transitions:` (for cross-subpipeline transitions) in `.liza/pipeline.yaml`.

## Task State Machines

Every role-pair in `.liza/pipeline.yaml` defines its own state names under `states:`. The generic flow is:

```
initial → executing → submitted → reviewing → approved (sprint-terminal)
               │ ↑                      ↓
               │ └───── rejected ──────┘
               └──→ BLOCKED
```

Cross-pair states (not pair-specific):
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed; see `blocked_reason` and `blocked_questions`
- **SUPERSEDED** — Replaced by tasks in `superseded_by` (terminal)
- **ABANDONED** — Killed by orchestrator (terminal)
- **MERGED** — Merged to integration branch (terminal, coding pair only)
- **INTEGRATION_FAILED** — Merge conflict or test failure (coding pair only)

To find the actual state names for a role-pair, check `role-pairs.<name>.states` in `.liza/pipeline.yaml`. Some pairs define extra states (e.g. `partially-approved`, `reviewing-2` for quorum review, or `clean` for no-issues-found).

## Sprint Lifecycle

```
IN_PROGRESS → CHECKPOINT → COMPLETED → (new sprint) IN_PROGRESS
```

### `liza resume` behavior depends on sprint state:

| Sprint State | Condition | Effect |
|--------------|-----------|--------|
| CHECKPOINT | Not all tasks terminal | Back to IN_PROGRESS (resume current sprint) |
| CHECKPOINT | All tasks terminal | Mark COMPLETED |
| COMPLETED | — | Archive sprint, create new one, execute pipeline transitions |

**Two-step advance:** To move from one pipeline phase to the next, run `liza resume` twice: first marks COMPLETED, second archives and advances.

### Checkpoint Actions

When a sprint checkpoints (status: CHECKPOINT), all agents pause. The human decides:

| Action | Command | When |
|--------|---------|------|
| Accept & resume | `liza resume` | Satisfied with output, continue |
| Amend & replan | Edit plan, commit, `liza replan` | Want to change planner output |
| Pipeline transition | `liza proceed <task-id> <transition>` | Create child tasks for next pair (auto-done by `liza resume` in batch) |
| Pause for manual work | (no command) | Make manual changes first |
| Abort | `liza stop` | Stop entirely |

### Replanning

When a planning sprint checkpoints (trigger: `PLANNING_COMPLETE`), the planner's `output[]` represents the proposed task breakdown.

```bash
# Typical replan workflow
# 1. Find planner output files — check the task's output[] in state.yaml
liza get tasks                         # identify the planning task
# 2. Edit the planner's output docs (e.g. specs/plan.md, specs/stories/*.md)
vim specs/plan.md                      # amend planner deliverables
# 3. If scope changed, also align upstream docs that fed the planner
#    (e.g. specs/goals/*.md, specs/epic.md) so inputs match outputs
git add -A && git commit -m "amend plan"
# 4. Replan
liza replan                            # auto-detects the planning task
liza replan <task-id>                  # or specify task ID explicitly
```

Replan invalidates the old task's output (preserved for audit, marked superseded), creates a new planning task with the same role-pair and spec, and returns the sprint to IN_PROGRESS. Multiple replans increment: `<task-id>-replan-1`, `<task-id>-replan-2`, etc.

### Auto-Resume

By default, checkpoints require manual `liza resume`. Auto-resume skips these gates:

- At init: `liza init --auto-resume "Goal"`
- At runtime: TUI `y` key toggles on/off

When enabled, agents auto-call `liza resume` on CHECKPOINT or COMPLETED. Use `liza pause` for a hard stop (never auto-resumed).

## Agent Review Cycles

### Doer: Submit → Await → Handle

```
liza submit-for-review → liza await-verdict → handle result
```

- **REJECTED**: Fix issues, resubmit (session stays alive — no cold restart)
- **APPROVED** / **NEW_ATTEMPT** / **TIMEOUT** / **ABORTED**: Exit normally

### Reviewer: Verdict → Await → Re-review

```
liza submit-verdict REJECTED → liza await-resubmission → review new changes
```

- **RESUBMITTED**: Review again (session stays alive)
- **TERMINAL** / **TIMEOUT** / **ABORTED**: Exit normally

## Agent Log Analysis

Agent logs (`.liza/agent-outputs/`) are the primary diagnostic tool.

**LLM-assisted** — use `/liza-logs` in any pairing agent session to cross-correlate logs, diagnose patterns, and propose fixes.

**CLI analyzer** (stdlib Python 3.12+):
```bash
python3 ~/.liza/skills/liza-logs/scripts/analyze-log.py .liza/agent-outputs/*.txt
```

**Browser analyzer** — drag-and-drop visual charts:
```bash
open ~/.liza/skills/liza-logs/tools/liza-session-analyzer.html   # or xdg-open on Linux
```

## Reading state.yaml

Use `liza` CLI commands for all state mutations. If a needed operation isn't covered, edit `.liza/state.yaml` directly but: write atomically (write to temp file, then rename), use ISO 8601 UTC timestamps (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`), and run `liza validate` afterward to verify invariants.

Key task fields:
- `status` — current state
- `assigned_to` — which agent holds the task (doer)
- `reviewing_by` — which agent is reviewing
- `lease_expires` / `review_lease_expires` — when the claim expires
- `base_commit` — commit the worktree was created from
- `review_commit` — commit submitted for review
- `merge_commit` — commit on integration branch after merge
- `iteration` — doer iteration count
- `review_cycles_current` / `review_cycles_total` — rejection count
- `blocked_reason` / `blocked_questions` — why the task is stuck
- `rejection_reason` — reviewer feedback on rejection
- `depends_on` — task IDs that must be terminal before this task is claimable
- `output[]` — structured output entries (used by `liza proceed` to create child tasks)
- `history[]` — timestamped event log per task

Key agent fields:
- `id` — e.g. `coder-1`, `code-reviewer-2`
- `role` — runtime role name
- `status` — STARTING, IDLE, WORKING, REVIEWING, WAITING, HANDOFF
- `lease_expires` — agent registration expiry
- `current_task` — task ID being worked on

## Agent Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning | Supervisor action |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| 0 | No more work for this role | Stop supervisor |
| 42 | Graceful abort (context exhaustion, lease lost, pause) | Restart immediately |
| Other | Crash | Restart with backoff |

Exit 42 with `handoff_pending: true` on the task means context exhaustion — the restarted agent reads handoff notes and continues.

## Common Failure Patterns

### Lease defaults

- Lease duration: 30 minutes
- Heartbeat interval: 60 seconds
- If lease expires, task becomes reclaimable

### Timestamp format

All timestamps in state.yaml use ISO 8601 UTC: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`
Generate: `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`

### Stuck task (stale lease)
**Symptom**: Task in executing or reviewing state but agent is gone.
**Diagnosis**: `liza get tasks` — check `lease_expires` is in the past (see Lease defaults above).
**Fix**: `liza recover-task <task-id>` or `liza release-claim <task-id>`.

### Agent crash loop
**Symptom**: Supervisor keeps restarting, agent exits non-zero repeatedly.
**Diagnosis**: Check agent output logs in `.liza/agent-outputs/` and the bootstrap prompt in `.liza/agent-prompts/` (what the agent was told to do).
**Fix**: After 5 restarts without progress, supervisor auto-blocks the task. Check `blocked_reason`. May need `liza recover-task` then manual investigation.

### BLOCKED task
**Symptom**: Task in BLOCKED state, agents skip it.
**Diagnosis**: Read `blocked_reason` and `blocked_questions` in state.yaml.
**Fix**: Either `liza supersede-task <id> [replacements] --reason "..."` (replace with new tasks or mark completed externally) or resolve the blocker and use `liza recover-task <id>` to reset.

### Integration failure
**Symptom**: Task in INTEGRATION_FAILED state.
**Diagnosis**: Merge conflict between task worktree and integration branch.
**Fix**: A coder can claim it (`integration_fix: true`). The worktree is preserved for conflict resolution.

### Sprint stuck at CHECKPOINT
**Symptom**: All agents idle, sprint in CHECKPOINT.
**Diagnosis**: `liza status` — check checkpoint trigger.
**Fix**: `liza resume` to continue, or `liza proceed` + `liza resume` to advance to next pipeline phase.

### Orphaned worktree
**Symptom**: `.worktrees/task-N/` exists but task is terminal.
**Diagnosis**: `liza validate` will flag this.
**Fix**: `liza wt-delete <task-id>`.

### Ghost agent
**Symptom**: Agent registered in state.yaml but process is dead.
**Diagnosis**: `liza get agents` — check lease expiry.
**Fix**: `liza recover-agent <agent-id>` or `liza delete agent <id>`.

### Provider quota exhausted
**Symptom**: All agents using a provider (e.g. Claude) have stopped. System mode is still RUNNING, sprint still IN_PROGRESS. Signal file `.liza/provider-quota-exhausted-<provider>` exists.
**Diagnosis**: `ls .liza/provider-quota-exhausted-*` or check `.liza/alerts.log` for `PROVIDER QUOTA EXHAUSTED`.
**Fix**: `liza pause` then `liza resume` — pause transitions RUNNING → PAUSED, resume clears quota signals and restarts the sprint. Then restart agents. (`liza resume` alone fails because the system is still RUNNING, not PAUSED.)

### Circuit breaker

`liza analyze` detects systemic patterns. Supervisor auto-triggers on:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Agent crash loop (3× in 5min) | Supervisor stops the agent |
| Blackboard validation fails | All agents pause |
| Integration branch conflict | Task set to INTEGRATION_FAILED |
| Circuit-breaker pattern in anomalies | CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TRIPPED mode, sprint CHECKPOINT, reports written |

## Validation Invariants

`liza validate` checks these (among others):
- Tasks in executing states must have `assigned_to`, `worktree`, and valid `lease_expires`
- Tasks in reviewing states must have `reviewing_by`, `review_lease_expires`, and `review_commit`
- Tasks in submitted states must have `review_commit`
- Tasks in rejected states must have `rejection_reason`
- BLOCKED tasks must have `blocked_reason` and `blocked_questions`
- MERGED tasks must not have `worktree`
- No two agents assigned to the same task
- Tasks in initial/draft states cannot have `assigned_to`
