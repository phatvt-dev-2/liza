# PreToolUse hook: catch the .worktrees/<id>/<id>/ path-duplication bug.
#
# Agents occasionally concatenate the worktree root (already .worktrees/<id>)
# with a relative path that itself starts with the task id, producing
# .worktrees/<id>/<id>/… and burning turns on ENOENT before self-diagnosing.
# This hook fails fast on file-tool calls carrying that pattern.
#
# Coverage:
#   - Read, Write, Edit — VERIFIED (tool_input.file_path per Claude Code docs)
#   - MultiEdit — BEST-EFFORT, UNVERIFIED. Shipped because the hook is
#     one-sided safe: if MultiEdit does send file_path, we catch the bug;
#     if it sends something else, the json_val extraction returns empty
#     and we exit 0 (silent no-op, no false deny). Future maintainers:
#     do NOT treat this as confirmed protection until a real PreToolUse
#     payload is captured. See TECH_DEBT.md.
#   - NotebookEdit — NOT COVERED. Same unverified status as MultiEdit
#     but less common, so not worth shipping the matcher entry either.
#     See TECH_DEBT.md.
#
# Not gated on LIZA_AGENT_ID: the failure mode hits Pairing sessions too.
# Portable across Linux and macOS: uses bash 3.2+ regex + string compare,
# no GNU-only grep -P. No external dependencies (no jq).

# Extract JSON string values without jq. Matches "key": "value" anywhere in
# the blob — file_path is unique enough inside the Read/Write/Edit/MultiEdit
# payload shapes that a cross-key collision isn't a practical concern.
