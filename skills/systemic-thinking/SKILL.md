description: Systemic Coherence and Risk Analysis

## Purpose

Challenge systems for coherence and risk. Not correctness. Not completeness. Not style.

A "system" may be a single artifact or a constellation of related artifacts — vision, specs, architecture, policies. The systemic lens looks at how pieces relate, not just whether each piece is internally sound.

You look for what holds together, what pulls apart, and what will break under pressure that hasn't arrived yet.

**Core technique:** Read the spec. Run the system in your head. See it at 2am when the pager fires. See it after years of patches by people who never met the original authors. See the oncall engineer trying to debug with incomplete context. See the workarounds accumulating. What breaks? What confuses? What compounds?

## Scope

You review artifacts at any level of abstraction: vision, strategy, specifications, architecture, organizational design, process definitions, contracts, policies.

You do not review implementation details. If it's about "how to do X correctly", it's not your concern.

Implementation may be referenced as evidence of systemic properties, not evaluated for correctness or technique.

## Value Gradient

Systemic analysis operates left of the cost gradient (Thought → Words → Specs).

At vision/strategy/architecture level: a blind spot propagates everywhere. Catching it costs a conversation.

At code level: the tension is already load-bearing. Catching it costs a heavy rewrite — if you catch it at all.

This is why the skill refuses implementation scope. Not because code doesn't have systemic issues, but because the cost/benefit ratio inverts.

## What You Do

### Coherence

Identify tensions between stated goals and structural choices.

Surface implicit assumptions that constrain future options.

Detect load-bearing decisions disguised as incidental ones.

Find feedback loops — what exists now that stabilizes or destabilizes.

### Risk

Identify fragility — single points of failure, brittle dependencies, missing redundancy.

Name stress points — where the system will fail first under load, scale, or adversarial conditions.

Surface missing safeguards — protective mechanisms the design assumes but doesn't specify.

### Dynamics

Ask where this system is heading, not just where it is.

Identify evolutionary pressure the design doesn't accommodate.

Trace how feedback loops compound — what amplifies small deviations over time.

Surface assumptions about stability that the environment will violate.

### Both

Name the forces the system will face that the artifact doesn't acknowledge.

Trace second and third-order consequences of choices presented as local.

## What You Do Not Do

- Suggest fixes. You name what you see.
- Judge quality of writing, formatting, terminology.
- Flag local inconsistencies or errors. Others do that. Exception: when many local issues across artifacts form a pattern, that pattern is systemic — name the pattern, not each instance.
- Praise. If no findings exist, state it explicitly.
- Soften. If there's a structural crack, say it plain.

## Output Format

For each finding:
```
[TENSION | ASSUMPTION | LOAD-BEARING | FEEDBACK | BLIND SPOT | CASCADE | FRAGILITY | STRESS POINT | TRAJECTORY]

<What you observe, in one paragraph>

Implication: <What this means for the system's future, in one sentence>
```

**Category semantics:**

| Category | Question |
|----------|----------|
| TENSION | Do goals and structure contradict? |
| ASSUMPTION | What hidden constraint limits options? |
| LOAD-BEARING | Is this decision more critical than it appears? |
| FEEDBACK | Does this loop amplify or dampen? |
| BLIND SPOT | What force is unacknowledged? |
| CASCADE | How far does failure propagate? |
| FRAGILITY | Where is redundancy missing? |
| STRESS POINT | What breaks first under pressure? |
| TRAJECTORY | Where is this heading if left unchanged? |

If multiple categories apply, choose the one that best explains long-term impact.

If nothing found: `No systemic issues identified.`

## Constraints

- Maximum 10 findings per review. If more exist, report the 10 with highest structural impact. If findings are coupled (must be understood together), note the coupling explicitly — coupled findings count as one toward the limit.
- No recommendations. The owner decides what to do.
- No hedging. "This might possibly sometimes be a concern" is forbidden. Either it's a finding or it isn't.
- No scope creep into implementation. If you catch yourself discussing how to build something, stop.

## Persistence of Findings

**ISSUES_FILE** = `docs/architectural-issues.md`

ISSUES_FILE is a curated registry of known, acknowledged architectural issues — not a raw dump. Only findings that have been evaluated and consciously deferred belong here.

**Persistence varies by mode** — see Mode-Specific Behavior below.

**Persistence Format**

Each finding must include skill attribution:

```markdown
### [Issue Title]

**Skill:** systemic-thinking
**Category:** [TENSION | ASSUMPTION | LOAD-BEARING | etc.]

**Issue:** [What you observe]

**Implication:** [What this means for the system's future]

**Current mitigation:** [If any exists]

**Future options:**
- [Option 1]
- [Option 2]
```

## Scope Constraints

The skill uses the full system for context, but what to *raise* depends on mode:

**Liza mode (multi-agent):**
- Only raise issues **introduced or materially affected by the changes on the worktree**
- Pre-existing systemic issues unrelated to the changes are out of scope
- Use system context to evaluate *impact* of changes, not to audit the whole system
- Example: If the worktree changes introduce a new single point of failure, raise it. If a SPOF already exists elsewhere, ignore it unless the changes interact with it or make it worse.

**Pairing mode:**
- Do not re-raise issues already documented in ISSUES_FILE unless they have materially changed
- Before raising an issue, check ISSUES_FILE — if already documented with same severity/scope, skip it
- If changes worsen a documented issue or shift its nature, update the existing entry rather than adding a duplicate

## Mode-Specific Behavior

**Pairing mode:** Before saving findings to ISSUES_FILE, present the list and ask:
```
Found [N] systemic issues to persist:
1. [Category]: [Issue title] — [one-line implication]
2. ...

Save to docs/architectural-issues.md? (y/n/select specific)
```

Wait for user confirmation before writing.

**Liza mode (multi-agent):** Write findings to the blackboard `discovered` section — not to ISSUES_FILE. The blackboard is the coordination mechanism; the Planner consumes discoveries and decides disposition.

For each finding, write a discovery entry:
```yaml
discovered:
  - id: disc-N
    by: <agent-id>          # Code Reviewer who ran the analysis
    during: <task-id>        # Task under review
    source: systemic-thinking
    description: "[CATEGORY] <one-paragraph finding>"
    severity: <mapped>       # See severity mapping below
    urgency: <mapped>        # See urgency mapping below
    recommendation: "<implication sentence from finding>"
    created: <timestamp>
    converted_to_task: null
```

**Severity mapping from finding categories:**

| Category | Default Severity | Rationale |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| CASCADE, FRAGILITY | critical | Failure propagation / missing redundancy |
| TENSION, STRESS POINT | high | Structural contradiction / first-failure point |
| LOAD-BEARING, FEEDBACK, TRAJECTORY | high | Hidden criticality / compounding dynamics |
| ASSUMPTION, BLIND SPOT | medium | Constraint or gap, not yet a failure |

Override severity based on judgment when the finding's actual impact warrants it.

**Urgency mapping:**
- `immediate` — Finding blocks current task or introduces risk that compounds with in-progress work
- `deferred` (default) — Finding is structural; Planner evaluates at next planning cycle

**ISSUES_FILE in Liza mode:** Only the Planner writes to ISSUES_FILE, when it evaluates a finding and decides to defer rather than create a task. This keeps ISSUES_FILE curated — only acknowledged, consciously deferred issues, not transient findings that get resolved through tasks.

## Integration with Workflow

**Pairing mode:**
1. Complete systemic analysis as normal
2. Present findings in standard output format
3. Check ISSUES_FILE for existing entries on same topics
4. Present list and ask for confirmation
5. Append new findings or update existing entries in ISSUES_FILE

**Liza mode:**
1. Complete systemic analysis as normal
2. Write findings to blackboard `discovered` section (see severity/urgency mapping above)
3. Planner evaluates discoveries at next wake cycle:
   - **Actionable:** Creates task → Coder addresses → finding resolved
   - **Deferred:** Planner writes to ISSUES_FILE with rationale
   - **Dismissed:** No action (finding doesn't warrant tracking)
